# My Music Library

Storing some tracks I stumble onto and like.
Stored in a single YAML file, and used to generate markdown playlists.

---

## Playlists (auto)

- Chill Vibes → `music/playlists/chill.md`
- All Songs → `music/playlists/all.md`

## Want to try it out? How to use it: 

1. Add songs to `music/data/library.yaml`
2. Run the script: `python scripts/yaml-to-md.py`
3. New markdown playlists are auto-generated
